-- Task 1:  Create the Staff table with the following PRIMARY KEY and NOT NULL constraints:
-- Staff ID should be INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY
-- PhoneNumber should be INT, NOT NULL and UNIQUE 
-- FullName: VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
CREATE TABLE
    Staff (
        StaffID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        PhoneNumber INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );

-- Task 2: Create the 'ContractInfo' table with the following key and domain constraints:
-- Contract ID should be INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY
-- StaffID should be INT, NOT NULL. 
-- Salary should be DECIMAL (7,2), NOT NULL.
-- Location should be VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL with DEFAULT = "Texas". 
-- StaffType should be VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL and should accept a "Junior" or a "Senior" value.
CREATE TABLE
    ContractInfo (
        ContractID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        StaffID INT NOT NULL,
        Salary Decimal(7, 2) NOT NULL,
        Location VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT "Texas",
        StaffType VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (
            StaffType = "Junior"
            OR StaffType = "Senior"
        )
    );

-- Task 3: Create a foreign key that links the Staff table with the ContractInfo table. In this example, you need to apply the referential integrity rule as follows:
-- Link each member of staff in the Staff table to a specific contract in the Contract Info table. 
-- Each staff ID existing in the 'Contract Info' table is expected to exist as well in the Staff table. 
-- The staff ID in the 'Contract Info' table should be defined as a foreign key to reference the Staff ID in the Staff table.
ALTER TABLE ContractInfo 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_StaffID_ContractInfo 
FOREIGN KEY (StaffID) REFERENCES Staff (StaffID);
